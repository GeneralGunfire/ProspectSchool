        description:
          'Thabo works at a Johannesburg manufacturing firm. He supplies his labour in the factor market. The firm pays him a wage of R20 000 per month. This is factor income flowing from firms → households.',

      options: ['Government spending on roads', 'Export earnings from mining', 'Household savings in a bank', 'Business investment in new machinery'],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        'Savings are a leakage — money that leaves the circular flow. Government spending, exports, and investment are injections that put money back into the flow.',

        'Total leakages equal total injections',
        'The government budget is balanced',
        'Imports equal exports',
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Equilibrium in the circular flow requires that total leakages (savings + tax + imports) equal total injections (investment + government spending + exports). Individual components need not balance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'A South African company exports R500 million worth of platinum to Japan. In the circular flow, this represents:',
      options: ['A leakage, because money leaves South Africa', 'An injection, because foreign money enters the circular flow', 'A transfer payment with no effect on the flow', 'A factor payment to households'],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Exports bring foreign spending into the domestic circular flow — this is an injection. Conversely, imports are a leakage as South Africans spend money outside the domestic economy.',

      options: ['Product market', 'Factor market', 'Money market', 'Capital market'],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Wages, rent, and interest are payments for factors of production (labour, land, capital). These flows occur in the factor (resource) market, not the product market.',
    },
    {
      question: 'If total injections into the circular flow are greater than total leakages, the economy will:',
      options: ['Contract — national income will fall', 'Stay the same — the model is always in equilibrium', 'Expand — national income will rise', 'Experience hyperinflation immediately'],
      answer: 2,
      explanation:
        'When injections > leakages, more money is being added to the circular flow than is being withdrawn. This causes the economy to expand — national income and output increase.',
    },

    {
      question: 'During a recession, the South African government increases its spending on infrastructure. Using the circular flow model, this policy:',
      options: [
        'Is a leakage that will shrink the circular flow further',
        'Is an injection that will stimulate national income and output',
        'Has no effect because government is not part of the two-sector model',
        'Will reduce household income by increasing taxes',
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Government spending is an injection in the three-sector circular flow. During a recession, injections < leakages. Increasing government spending raises injections, stimulating the economy — this is Keynesian fiscal policy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'South Africa\'s household savings rate is very low. What is the most likely consequence for the circular flow?',
      options: [
        'Higher leakages, leading to economic contraction',
        'Lower leakages, meaning more money circulates — but less is available for business investment',
        'No effect, because savings do not enter the circular flow',
        'Higher injections, because savings fund government projects directly',
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Low savings means fewer leakages from the product market, so more money circulates immediately. However, banks have less to lend to firms for investment — reducing a key injection. The net effect depends on whether the reduced investment injection outweighs the reduced savings leakage.',
    },
    {
      question: 'In the full five-sector circular flow (adding financial sector and foreign sector), which combination correctly pairs leakages with their corresponding injections?',
      options: [
        'Savings ↔ Taxation; Imports ↔ Government Spending; Tax ↔ Exports',
        'Savings ↔ Investment; Tax ↔ Government Spending; Imports ↔ Exports',
        'Savings ↔ Exports; Tax ↔ Investment; Imports ↔ Government Spending',
        'Savings ↔ Government Spending; Imports ↔ Investment; Tax ↔ Exports',
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Savings are channelled back as investment (via financial institutions), tax is returned as government spending, and import payments are offset by export earnings. These three pairs form the leakage-injection framework of the complete circular flow.',
    },
    {
      question: 'A sudden depreciation of the rand makes South African exports cheaper and imports more expensive. What is the MOST LIKELY effect on the circular flow?',
      options: [
        'Leakages increase and injections decrease — economy contracts',
        'Leakages decrease (fewer imports) and injections increase (more exports) — economy expands',
        'No effect because exchange rates only affect the financial sector',
        'Households earn higher wages because firms export more',
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation:
        'A weaker rand raises the cost of imports (reducing import leakage) and makes exports more competitive (increasing the export injection). Both effects push toward expansion — though the timing depends on the Marshall-Lerner condition and supply capacity.',
