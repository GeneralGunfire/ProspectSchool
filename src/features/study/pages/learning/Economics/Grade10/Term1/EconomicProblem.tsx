      content: 'A NEED is something essential for survival: food, water, shelter, clothing, healthcare.

The opportunity cost is whichever of those alternatives would have provided the greatest benefit. Choosing roads means forgoing that alternative — scarcity forces the trade-off.' },
      { id: 2, instruction: 'Scenario: A Grade 10 student spends 3 hours on social media instead of studying', math: 'Opportunity cost = the exam marks not earned (foregone study time)', explanation: 'The 3 hours on social media have an opportunity cost: the improvement in exam marks and understanding that studying for 3 hours would have produced. The cost is not money — it is the foregone academic achievement.' },
      { id: 3, instruction: 'Scenario: A farmer plants maize instead of sunflowers on his land', math: 'Opportunity cost = the profit from sunflowers foregone', explanation: 'The farmer\'s land is a scarce resource — it can only be used for one crop at a time. By choosing maize, the farmer foregoes whatever profit sunflowers would have generated. That foregone profit is the opportunity cost of the maize decision.' },

      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'The economic problem exists because we cannot have everything we want.',
      explanation: 'The economic problem is caused by SCARCITY — human wants are unlimited but the resources (land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship) available to satisfy those wants are finite. This forces individuals, businesses, and governments to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources.'

      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that was NOT chosen.',
      explanation: 'The opportunity cost is the R8 000 per month she would have earned in the job — the benefit she gave up by choosing university. Tuition fees and textbooks are monetary costs, not opportunity costs. Opportunity cost specifically refers to the VALUE of the FOREGONE ALTERNATIVE.'
    },
    {
      id: 'q3', question: 'Which of the following is the BEST example of a NEED?', math: '',
      options: ['A new gaming console', 'A meal to prevent starvation', 'A holiday to Durban', 'A second car for convenience'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'A need is essential for survival — you cannot live without it.',
      explanation: 'Food (a meal to prevent starvation) is a basic need — it is essential for survival. A gaming console, holiday, and second car are wants — desirable but not essential. The distinction matters in economics because scarcity forces prioritisation of needs over wants.'
    },
    {
      id: 'q4', question: 'South Africa must choose whether to invest in renewable energy or expand coal mining. This decision directly addresses which of the three economic questions?', math: '',
      options: ['FOR WHOM to produce', 'HOW to produce energy', 'WHAT to produce — which energy sources to develop', 'None of the three — this is a political question only'],
      correctIndex: 2, hint: 'The decision is about WHICH type of energy production to develop — what the economy will produce.',
      explanation: 'Choosing between renewable energy and coal mining is a "WHAT to produce" question — which goods and services the economy will prioritise. It also involves "HOW to produce" (production methods), but the primary question is WHAT energy infrastructure to develop. All three economic questions often overlap in real decisions.'
    },
  ],
  remediationQuestions: [
    {
      id: 'r1', question: 'Why does scarcity force people to make choices?', math: '',
      options: ['Because money is always limited', 'Because resources are limited but wants are unlimited — you cannot have everything', 'Because the government controls spending', 'Because prices are too high'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'Scarcity means there is not enough of everything — so you must choose.',
      explanation: 'Scarcity means limited resources relative to unlimited wants. Since you cannot satisfy all wants simultaneously, you must choose which wants to satisfy. Every choice means giving something up — which is what makes economics necessary as a discipline.'
    },
    {
      id: 'r2', question: 'A business has R50 000 and must choose between buying a new delivery van OR upgrading its computer system. It chooses the van. What is the opportunity cost?', math: '',
      options: ['The R50 000 spent on the van', 'The upgraded computer system that was not purchased', 'The petrol costs for the van', 'The cost of both options combined'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'Opportunity cost is what you gave up — the alternative you did NOT choose.',
      explanation: 'The opportunity cost is the upgraded computer system — the benefit the business would have gained from that alternative but gave up. The R50 000 is just the monetary cost; opportunity cost is specifically the VALUE of the foregone alternative (the computer upgrade benefits).'
    },
  ],
  hardQuestions: [
    {
      id: 'h1', question: 'South Africa has an unemployment rate of about 32%. From an economic perspective, what does this represent?', math: '',
      options: ['An abundance of labour resources — good for the economy', 'A misallocation of scarce labour resources — idle labour is an economic problem', 'Proof that scarcity does not apply to human labour', 'A purely social problem with no economic implications'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'Labour is a scarce resource — idle labour means scarce resources are being wasted.',
      explanation: 'High unemployment is an economic problem because labour is a scarce resource. When workers are unemployed, their productive capacity is idle — the economy produces less than it could. This represents a misallocation (or non-use) of scarce human resources, resulting in lower output, lower incomes, and reduced living standards. It is both an economic and social problem.'
    },
    {
      id: 'h2', question: 'The concept of opportunity cost applies to governments as well. If South Africa\'s government increases spending on social grants, what is the likely opportunity cost?', math: '',
      options: ['There is no opportunity cost — the government can print more money', 'Reduced spending on infrastructure, education, or healthcare (the next best alternative)', 'Higher taxes are the opportunity cost', 'The opportunity cost is zero because social grants benefit everyone'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'Government budgets are limited — spending more here means spending less somewhere else.',
      explanation: 'Government revenue (taxes) is scarce. Increasing social grant spending means the SAME money cannot be spent on infrastructure, schools, or hospitals. The opportunity cost is the value of those foregone alternatives — whatever would have provided the next greatest benefit. This is why government budgeting is fundamentally an exercise in applying opportunity cost reasoning.'
    },
    {
      id: 'h3', question: 'How does opportunity cost relate to the concept of "there is no such thing as a free lunch"?', math: '',
      options: ['It means businesses should never offer free promotions', 'Even "free" things have a cost — someone always pays or something is always given up', 'It is a statement about restaurant economics, not economics theory', 'Free trade agreements eliminate opportunity cost'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'If something appears free to you, think about what it cost someone else — or what you gave up to get it.',
      explanation: '"There is no such thing as a free lunch" captures the essence of opportunity cost. Even when something is "free" (subsidised, donated, or gifted), resources were used to produce it — those resources had alternative uses. The opportunity cost was borne by someone (the taxpayer, the donor, or the producer). Nothing is truly free in economics because all resources are scarce.'
    },
    {
      id: 'h4', question: 'A country can produce either 100 units of food OR 50 units of clothing (or combinations). If it chooses to produce 100 units of food and 0 clothing, what is the opportunity cost of the LAST unit of food?', math: '',
      options: ['Zero — the country chose food, so clothing has no value', 'The clothing production that was sacrificed to produce that last unit of food', 'R100 — the market price of a unit of food', 'The opportunity cost is the same for all units of food'],
      correctIndex: 1, hint: 'This is the production possibility concept — what must be given up to produce one more unit of a good?',
      explanation: 'The opportunity cost of each additional unit of food is the clothing production that must be given up to produce it. If all resources are used for food (100 units), then ZERO clothing is produced — all potential clothing output has been sacrificed. The opportunity cost of the last unit of food is the clothing that could have been made with those same resources. This introduces the concept of the Production Possibility Curve (PPC).'
